\begin{abstract}
	Home security has been a major issue where crime is increasing and everybody wants to take proper measures to prevent intrusion. In addition there was a need to automate home so that user can take advantage of the technological advancement in such a way that a person getting off the office does not get melted with the hot climate. Advance security system is project in which we provide users to use such type of technology and improve security of home and office. By using such type of technology we can control unwanted activity. Purpose behind developing this project is that to protect from theft to our society and also protect from criminal. In this we will develop a security system in which authorized users can enter in home or office every member of home or office will be identified by its finger print or face by using biometric and all these details will be stored on a web page which can be access by admin only and in case of unauthorized person an image of that person will be send on server as well as on mobile phone of admin. This advance security system also has feature that door of the office or home will not be unlocked until user is not authorized. All activity like who entered in home will be store and also notify on mobile phone to a particular no. such type of technology is very useful for those industries in which they required privacy and it can be used also at home and these all activities through a remote or a mobile. For developing such type of project we required some concept of IOT and MATLAB for image processing of fingerprint.\\

{\large \bf Introduction:-}\\
\\
The aim of our project is to provide privacy and security to a particular Home or companies from remote locations from a central Server system.
The idea of having a full control over the places where we live and work has always been a fascinating subject to fantasize no matter at what age! As the technology improved in recent decades, human being gained more power on controlling various devices indoors. However, having this control remotely still remains an incomplete yet developing matter in industry. \\

The Project entitled “ ADVANCE SECURITY SYSTEMS” highlights the above mentioned issue and offers ways to overcome this need by employing two of the most widely used features of today’s technology – SMS to be applied as a bridge in between human and fully automated buildings, GSM standard which ensures perfect compatibility between networks and mobile phones in any location.\\


In this project, the system allows the home owner or company owner to monitor and control the house security like Whose entered, Door lock or door unlocked,  which can be switched on or off via the mobile phone set by sending commands in the form of SMS and also the home owner can receive the appliances status. \\

When a message was received from the GSM then the micro controller will display that message on LCD at the end of the message a number is received based on that number the micro controller will does the coresponinding operation to that number like switching the devices ON and OFF. and the date and time of that message received is displayed on LCD display.
