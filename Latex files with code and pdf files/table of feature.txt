The design of a biometric and web cam based door locking security system using IOT and MATLAB is a complex design which
comprises of so many modules (parts) brought together to form the overall design. Each of these modules is
made up of discrete components and modules that are joined together to achieve a particular purpose. 
These separate modules are: The Power Supply Unit, The Buzzer Unit, The micro controller Unit, Webcam unit, Biometric unit, GSM unit, Image processing unit
Switching unit.
These different units can be function alone, for the desired result they all need to function together.
